Virtual Exhibition: 50 Years of the Architecture Building - Toronto Metropolitan University
Project Overview

This project is a virtual exhibition celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Architecture building at Toronto Metropolitan University. The exhibition aims to showcase the rich history, architectural significance, and evolution of this iconic building over the past five decades. Using Unreal Engine 5.2.1, we have created an immersive virtual experience that allows users to explore the buildingâ€™s milestones, notable designs, and key moments in its history.

Features
